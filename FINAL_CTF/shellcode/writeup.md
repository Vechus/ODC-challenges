# Shellcode

Looking the program on ghidra: basically the program lets you input code that will be executed.

see: exploit.py (generated with `pwn template` command).

My exploit just sends the shellcode to the server. 
The shellcode is the same I used in every challenge and was originally taken from shellstorm.
